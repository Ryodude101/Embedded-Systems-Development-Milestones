libOpenCM3 is a fairly simple hardware abstraction
library (HAL).  However, it does cover four families
of ARM-Cortex and devices from dozens of manufacturers
totally hundreds of processors. The ALU of these chips
are similar, but the hardware peripherals vary widely.
Sometimes, it is challenging to get started with a
new HW peripheral via the libOpenCM3 API.

The documentation explains the API function calls and 
constants, but sometimes a concrete example is more
enlightening.  To assist you there, you might want
to peruse the following repo:

     https://github.com/libopencm3/libopencm3-examples

Dive down into examples/stm32

Pay special attention to the Cortex-M4 examples
in the f4 and l4 folders.  We are targeting a L4
device.  The F4 devices from STM are very similar
and their configuration is not terribly different.
Find an example that does actions similar to what
you want. Read the code examples.

DO NOT USE THE CODE BLINDLY. THAT ALMOST NEVER WORKS.

Try to understand the code, then investigate
the details of the libOpenCM3 documentation
associated with this example code, then cross-reference
with the datasheet for the chip in question. Once
you understand the big picture, hop over into the L452
datasheet and look for differences.... working your
way back up through the libOpenCM3 to code (often
adjusted or modified from the examples) that will
work with the L452.

While these examples are very simplistic and not
likely to be exactly what you need for your
particular design, they often provide a great
starting point for your code.
