Another extremely useful programmer's tool when dealing
with "evolving" code is a "diff" utility. The original
diff utility is a command-line tool that generates a
"diff patch".  That is useful in some situations and
I encourage to be familiar with reading the diff patch
output a bit.

For development purposes, I find the graphical diff
tools much more helpful.  Many exist and your linux
or MacOS may already have one.  Others can be installed
and many are supported on multiple platforms.

Over the years, I have used (and found useful):
meld (my current favorite), Kompare, Diffuse, and
xxdiff.

On the Windows platform, there are several to choose from,
including meld.  Search for "Windows graphical diff tool"
to find some suggestions.

You can link your favority diff tool into your revision
control client like "git".  This handy to resolve conflicts
which will result when we start collaborative team-based
code development.
