The code skeleton provided is **NOT** complete.  It may
even have errors in it.  (If you do find an error, please
email the details to me so I can correct.)

The scaffolding in folder "m1a" is a template that you
can use to get a ARM-Cortex program up and running quickly.
You should be able to copy the contents of this folder into
a new folder, change the source, and recompile.  This is
exactly the process you will follow to use the file in "m1b".

You must read and understand the skelton provided to
you.  In doing so, you should be able to identify what
is missing. It is usually callled out.  For example,
you will want to examine:

* Makefile where the path to the libOpenCM3 folder is 
  defined.  Search for "CM3_DIR".
