The utility "grep" is often crucial to an embedded systems
designer.  The source code for your build is often spread
across numerous trees.  In this task, your design is built
from code in the directories here, PLUS the tree containing
libOpenCM3.

(Keep these trees separated. Sometimes, you need to update
the libOpenCM3 from the repository.  You do not want that
update operation to corrupt the code that you have written.)

Later in the semester, your designs will incorporate my
operating system.  It too relies on libOpenCM3 for its
hardware access.  My OS will reside in its own folder --
making at least three trees for a program.

As you try to navigate and wrap your head around all that
is going on, it is often useful to find all the occurences
of a variable or function call, etc.  The tool "grep" is
your friend.

I strongly recommend you get "grep" working on your machine.
(It is built-in with linux and MacOS.)  Learn at least the
basics of grep.  It is a powerful tool!



PS: To tell you how useful grep is, note that computer publisher
    O'Reilly has an entire book dedicated to this one little utility.
